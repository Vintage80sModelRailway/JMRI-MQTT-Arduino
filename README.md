# JMRI-MQTT-Arduino
The code from one of my Arduino nodes that communicates with JMRI over Ethernet.

Do not copy and paste all of this code onto your layout!

It's specific to mine and includes

        Support for multiple PWM boards running multiple servos
        Shift in registers
        Shift out registers
        Directly connected sensors
        Fast servo movement
        Slow servo movement
        Electrofrog polarity switching
        
It's here as a reference more than anything and would be most useful if the most useful bits to anyone were copied and pasted into their own code.
